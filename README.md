# An iOS Scriptable calendar widget for tracking "busyness"

## Original Inspiration:
https://github.com/rudotriton/scriptable-calendar-widget

## The definition of "busyness"
To keep things simple a "busy" day is defined as a day with one calendar event. This widget doesn't consider a person's work calendar, so a work day without a personal event is still considered "free".

The only exception to this rule is the "Oncall" event. The "Oncall" event is tracked but not currently used anywhere.
